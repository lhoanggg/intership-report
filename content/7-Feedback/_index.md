> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at FCJ is very friendly and open. Colleagues and mentors are always willing to support me whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is clean and comfortable, which helps me stay focused and productive. However, I think having a larger office area would provide interns with more opportunities to work on-site.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provided detailed guidance and clear explanations whenever I struggled to understand an issue, and always encouraged me to ask questions. The admin team offered full support, from sharing knowledge and documents to creating opportunities for me to participate in events. I truly appreciate that the mentors and admin team allowed me to experiment and solve problems on my own instead of simply giving me the answers.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks assigned to me aligned well with the knowledge I learned in my major, while also exposing me to new areas that I had never explored before. This helped me reinforce my foundational knowledge while gaining practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I had the opportunity to work with many new technologies, especially cloud-related services and tools. In addition, I learned more about project management, teamwork, and professional communication. The mentors also shared valuable real-world experience, giving me clearer direction for my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: people respect one another, work seriously yet maintain a cheerful atmosphere. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company provided flexible working hours when needed. Moreover, being able to participate in workshops and networking activities was a great advantage.

### Additional Questions
- What I am **most satisfied with** is the opportunity to work directly with AWS services and experience the professional environment at Amazon Web Services Vietnam. The mentors guided me enthusiastically and allowed me to experiment and solve problems myself instead of giving me ready-made answers. Thanks to this, I learned a lot of practical knowledge about cloud computing and serverless development.

- I think the company could **expand the office space** so interns have more chances to work directly on-site. Having more workspace would improve communication, learning, and interaction with mentors and team members.

- **Absolutely yes**, I would recommend this internship to my friends. AWS Vietnam is an ideal environment for those who want to develop cloud-related skills, especially in Software Engineering or DevOps. You get to work with modern technologies, learn from experienced mentors, and experience an open, proactive, and creativity-driven culture.

### Suggestions & Expectations
- I truly hope to continue joining future programs or opportunities from AWS, as this environment helps me learn more about cloud technologies and grow in the right direction for my career.

- I would like to express my sincere gratitude to AWS Vietnam—especially to Master Hưng, Mr. Kha, and the entire FCJ admin/mentor team—for providing such a professional, supportive, and open internship environment. This has been a valuable experience that helped me grow in both technical skills and professional work ethic.
