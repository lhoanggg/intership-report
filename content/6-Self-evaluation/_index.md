During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam** from **09/08/2025** to **11/28/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply knowledge about cloud computing, particularly AWS services, in a real working environment.  

I participated in backend development for an application using TypeScript, deploying Lambda Functions and API Gateway on AWS, through which I improved my skills in **TypeScript programming, designing and deploying serverless backend, managing API Gateway, integrating Lambda with other AWS services, as well as writing technical reports and optimizing system performance.**  

Regarding work attitude, I always strive to complete tasks efficiently, follow company regulations, and actively communicate with colleagues to enhance productivity in a DevOps and Cloud environment.
